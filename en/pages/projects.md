# Project Directory
Here are some nifty things people have made in A-Frame (as well as WebXR in general). Feel free to add your project here to section at the bottom of the page.
### Btw: Getting your project onto the Quest 2 browser's new-tab page?
Ever opened your quest and wondered where those suggest webxr projects come from? [Here's their submission criteria and process](https://developer.oculus.com/documentation/oculus-browser/browser-new-tab/).
### Also: PWA's on quest 2
- Progressive Web Apps are a way to install a webpage as if it were an app. This is now supported on the quest 2! Check it out:
https://web.dev/pwas-on-oculus-2/
PWA's can be published on apps stores! See [here](https://pwabuilder.com/) for more info.

This are also WebXR apps you can experience in VR, but is it either unknown if they are built in A-Frame or certain that they aren't.

Polished painting app
* [Powder](https://tyrovr.com/powder/)
Ski down an infinite slope.

### Old WebVR (pre-WebXR spec) projects
These won't run in modern WebXR browsers that lack WebVR support (like the Chromium-based Oculus browser on the Quest). They would need to be updated to the new WebXR spec to work--until that work is done, they remain in the state they're in, but many of them were impressive in their own right. As of this writing, you can still, however, run these projects in the old firefox browser on the Quest 2.
* [Couch.Live](https://couch.live/)
Hang out in a nice living room and watch content together.
* [A-Painter](https://aframe.io/a-painter)
One of the early projects by Mozilla to demonstrate A-Frame's potential
* [Supercraft](https://supermedium.com/supercraft/)
A tool to build VR apps in VR.
* [Supershooter](https://supermedium.com/aframe-super-shooter-kit/examples/supercraft/)
Demo shooter built in supercraft, to showcase a [toolset](https://github.com/supermedium/aframe-super-shooter-kit) that has fallen out of date to enable quickly building shooter apps.
#### hand tracking
* [Theramin](https://vrtheremin.glitch.me/)
Probably the VR instrument that makes the most sense for hand tracking demos
### Other Collections
It's common for people to build collections and then for them to sit unmaintained. You may find cool stuff (if so, add a link here directly!), you may find old broken stuff.
* [Zesty Directory](https://zestymarket.github.io/zesty-directory/)
They are focused on support for an SDK that allows metaverse monetization through selling billboard space with NFTs. Most recently updated as of this writing.
* [XRapp.store](https://xrapp.store/)
Collection of Oculus Labs + WebXR content, seems pretty up to date
* [WebVR.directory](https://webvr.directory/)
A collection maintained by Supermedium
* [Construct Arca.de](https://constructarca.de/vr/)
An arcade site that features a few high quality webXR and webVR projects. Most still work.
* [THREE WebXR samples](https://threejs.org/examples/?q=webxr#webxr_ar_paint)
* [XRswim](https://xrswim.com/)
(Seemingly stale collection from early 2020)
XR-swim had a [couple](https://www.roadtovr.com/xr-swim-webxr-platform-store/) [press](https://vrscout.com/news/xr-swim-web-vr-ar-platform/) [releases](https://servreality.com/news/xr-swim-a-free-platform-for-content-webxr/) about becoming the storefront for webxr, but seemed to not get updated. Features a lot of webVR (spec before webxr) content that no longer works on webxr spec browsers, but also has many lots of good webXR content. Seems untouched since April 2020 as of this writing in early 2021.
* [Original A-Frame Showcase](https://aframe.io/showcase/)
From the A-Frame docs, currently out of date

* [XRCA.DE](http://XRca.de)
A small curated collection, but does include the out-of-date A-Painter, so not sure about the rest
