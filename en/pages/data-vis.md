# Libraries for Graphing
## aframe-babia-components (BabiaXR)
[source](https://gitlab.com/babiaxr/aframe-babia-components)
Maintained. Data visualization/management components.
## a-framedc
[original source](https://github.com/fran-aguilar/a-framedc)
[fork showing working demos](https://github.com/kylebakerio/a-framedc)
[another fork with some possible improvements](https://github.com/k6yeung/a-framedc)
Source not touched in 4 years, but can work up to pre-1.2.0 (THREE.Geometry errors beyond that).
## aframe-charts-components
[source](https://github.com/adrixp/aframe-charts-component)
More recent, though still untouched in about 2 years. Looks less feature-rich than a-framedc.
