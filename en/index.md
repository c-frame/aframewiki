# Welcome to the A-Frame Wiki

This is the modern home of the successor to the discontinued A-Frame Registry, the [Component Directory](https://aframe.wiki/en/#!pages/component-directory.md).

## Sponsoring

Support A-Frame by <a href="https://github.com/sponsors/dmarcos">becoming a dmarcos sponsor on GitHub</a>, or <a href="https://cottonbureau.com/products/a-frame-og#/9479538/tee-men-standard-tee-vintage-black-tri-blend-s">buying a shirt</a>, or by [sponsoring maintainers on specific tasks](https://github.com/c-frame/sponsorship).

If you've done that and want to also support this wiki's server and the aframe.wiki domain cost by donating a coffee, you can do that here:<br>
